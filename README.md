# CABPP
 C implemented Automata Based Programming Pattern

## Requirements
- Windows machine

- yEd graph editor

## Steps to install
- Download git (recursively)
- ´make´ in main folder (Makefiles are included)

## Project Description
I already did something similar in Python which you can check in my other repo.

Goal of this project would be to use the documentation as the code. The graphs serve as the behaviour logic of each c++ module.
Macros are included in the common folder headers.

## TODO;
I need to implement some more explanations here.
