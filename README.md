# CABPP
 C implemented Automata Based Programming Pattern

## Requirements
- Windows machine
- __MinGW__ + __g++__ | __clang++__
- __tinyxml2__ (submodule included in this repo)
- __yEd Graph Editor__

## Steps to install
- Clone this git repository (recursively)
- `make all` in main folder (Makefiles are included)
- if everything went ok all binaries will be built in the ./build folder
- settings and graphs are handled in the xmlsettings folder
- Execute the code with `./build/framework.exe`

## Project Description
I already did something similar in Python which you can check in my other repo.

Goal of this project would be to use the documentation as the code. The graphs serve as the behaviour logic of each c++ module.
Macros are included in the common folder headers.

## TODO;
I need to implement some more explanations here. In short this is a framework with makefile for building modules which it can handle.
